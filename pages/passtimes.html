            <h3>Hobbies Favorite Activities</h3>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, I like running track and playing music.  You know, I've always been pretty fast for my size and age, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it through the years.  At the end of my
                 Sophomore year of high school, I became very serious about it and decided to try to use it to get into college.  Every year I get increasingly faster and take on more events.  My firsts year, I ran the 55m, 100m, 200m,
                 and 300m races. The next year, I took on the 100m, 200m, 400m, and Long Jump.  This was my first year doing long jump and by the end of the season, my best jump distance was 18'6" and my 100m time was 11.94s.  I intend
                 to train hard this summer to do better in my junior year.
                 I've also been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old.  At first I wasn't interested and I would only go to classes because my parents would force me.
                 Now I no longer take lessons, but I enjoy playing and try to find time to teach myself when I can.  I also have a younger cousin who likes to play with me on the drums 
                 whenever he comes over.  So we play together sometimes and it actually sounds better than you think it would.
