        <h3>Life Story</h3>
        <p>As you already know, my name is Michael Newby and was born and raised in Harlem, NY.  Ya boy grew up with a twin brother and a slightly younger sister.  The first school that I went to was The Red Balloon School in Harlem for pre-k.  This is where he met my life-long friend.  The next year, I moved on
            to go to P.S. 87 on the upper west side, where I unconciously started to discover what I was interested in, performing and entertaining.  I found myself drawing a lot on my own, and with a couple friends, and playing instruments.  It eventually became something I was really good at.  In the 4th
            grade, I switched schools to attend George Jackson Academy, a start-up all boys private school, which obviously I wasn't excited about.  There I got into quiet a bit of touble with some other kids (but a room full of black people from the ghetto... what would you expect?) and stopped drawing.  But I continued to progress in music  
            After a couple years, I grew to learn from my mistakes and managed to stay out of trouble in school until I graduated.  After graduating, I went on to attend the Trevor Day School.  It was a MAJOR culture shock for me, but it was also where I discovered my love of track.  Although, there are a lot of differences 
            between me and the other students in the PWI, I found a small group of people who I had a lot in common with and they became my core group of friends.
