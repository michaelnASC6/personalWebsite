            As you already know, my name is Michael Newby and was born and raised in Harlem, NY.  I grew up with a 
            twin brother and a younger sister.  The first school that I went to was The Red Balloon School in Harlem 
            for pre-k.  This is where I met my life-long bestfriend.</p>

           <p id="ps-gja">The next year, I moved on to go to P.S. 87 on 
            the upper west side.  There, I found myself drawing a lot.  It eventually became something I was really 
            good at.  After 3rd grade, I switched schools to attend George Jackson Academy, a start-up, predominantly black, all boys 
            private school.  </p>

            <p id="abtgja">I knew absolutely nothing about this school, but I was not excited about leaving P.S. 87.  
            Nothing too special happened in public school, but I enjoyed the people I had met there.  At GJA, I stopped 
            drawing and I started to get interested in music.  I made many mistakes, just like anyone else does, but  over my years at 
            GJA, I grew to learn from them and that played a huge roll in making me the person I am today.  </p>

            <p id="trevorDay"> After graduating, I went on to attend my current school, the Trevor Day School, a predominantly white school.  For me, 
                switching to this school was a MAJOR culture shock, but it was also where I discovered my love of track.  Although, I 
                came from a totally different background than most of the other students in the PWI (Predominantly White Insitution), 
                I was able to find a small group of people who I had a lot in common with.  After a short period of time, they became 
                my core group of friends in and out of school.</p>
