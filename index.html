        <h3>Life Story</h3>
        <p>As you already know, my name is Michael Newby and was born and raised in Harlem, NY.  Ya boy grew up with a twin brother and a slightly younger sister.  The first school that I went to was The Red Balloon School in Harlem for pre-k.  This is where he met my life-long friend.  The next year, I moved on
            to go to P.S. 87 on the upper west side, where I unconciously started to discover what I was interested in, performing and entertaining.  I found myself drawing a lot on my own, and with a couple friends, and playing instruments.  It eventually became something I was really good at.  In the 4th
            grade, I switched schools to attend George Jackson Academy, a start-up all boys private school, which obviously I wasn't excited about.  There I got into quiet a bit of touble (a room full of black people from the ghetto... what would you expect?) and stopped drawing.  But I continued to progress in music  
            After a couple years, I grew to learn from my mistakes and managed to stay out of trouble in school until I graduated.  After graduating, I went on to attend the Trevor Day School.  It was a MAJOR culture shock for me, but it was also where I discovered my love of track.  Although, there are a lot of differences 
            between me and the other students in the PWI, I found a small group of people who I had a lot in common with and they became my core group of friends.

            <h3>Hobbies Favorite Activities</h3>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, I like running track and playing music.  I've always been pretty fast for my size and age, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it through the years.  At the end of my
                 Sophomore year of high school, I became very serious about it and decided to try to use it to get into college.  Every year I get increasingly faster and take on more events.  My firsts year I ran the 55m, 100m, 200m,
                  and 300m races. The next year, I took on the 100m, 200m, 400m, and Long Jump.  This was my first year doing long jump and by the end of the season, my best jump distance was 18'6" and my 100m time was 11.94s.  I intend
                 to train hard this summer to do better in my junior year.
